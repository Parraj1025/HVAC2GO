The walkthroughs include written instructions from experienced software engineers with a background in HVAC, along with instructional videos to guide users through potential solutions. If customers require further assistance, they can opt to connect with licensed, insured, and certified HVAC technicians through the app. These technicians can provide visual instructions via platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, or Skype for a fixed duration of 30 minutes. If the issue remains unresolved, customers can choose to have their data passed on to local HVAC companies for a discounted service call, leveraging the relationships established by the app.
